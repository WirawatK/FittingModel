# FittingModel
This project is a part of PSI2023 Numerical Method course coordinate by Eric and Dustin. Further reading [Data analysis recipes: Fitting a model to data](arXiv:1008.4686v1). This code works on Julia 1.8.5 `(lastest updated 03/16/23)`.

We will investigate in the following questions:
Question 1 Linear&Quadratic fitting 
Question 2 Investigating m&b plane
Question 3 Line parameterization
